Good morning sir,

My name is Neeraj Goswami, I was born in Pachmarhi but now I'm in Jabalpur,

Coming onto my technical skills, I'm proficient in C++, SQL, DBMS and Frontend Web Development, on the basis of my technical skills I create a project that is related to health and hospitals,

Apart from that, I'm quite good at project management I know how agile and scrum actually used to develop a project.

I learned tableau and power BI on my own and make some appreciable Dashboard,

As per my forte, I'm good in SQL.

Thank you.
